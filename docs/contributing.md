# Contributing
Hello, collaborators! It's me, Scolder. If you ever want to archive some projects, i'll show you how.

# Step One: Find the project ID
This one is super easy, but i'll explain anyway. When you go to a scratch project, the numbers in the link is the ID. You need it. Try copying it, writing it down, or keeping the webpage open.
# Step Two: Install some software
Install the latest versionof Python3. Then, install pip. Using pip, run this command:

> **pip install requests**

This should install the packages to run a certain program. Next, you'll want to download the *main.py* file in my __projectgrabber__ repository. Run that in python, and when the program tells you to press enter, **don't.**
Instead, paste the Project ID (no spaces) into the input, and it'll load that instead of a random project. Then, check the place where you kept the *main.py* file, and you'll notice a new file is now there. Upload the into the projects folder of this repo (in a branch), and make a PR so I can accept it later.
# Step Three: Find a rock
Find a rock. Found one? Great. You're done.
