# Contributing

Hello, collaborators! It's me, Scolder. If you ever want to archive some projects, i'll show you how.

# Step One: Find the project ID

This one is super easy, but i'll explain anyway. When you go to a scratch project, the numbers in the link is the ID. You need it. Try copying it, writing it down, or keeping the webpage open.

# Step Two: Install some software

Install the latest versionof Python3. Then, install pip. Using pip, run this command:

> **pip install requests**

This should install the packages to run a certain program. Next, you'll want to download the _main.py_ file in my **projectgrabber** repository. Run that in python, and when the program tells you to press enter, **don't.**
Instead, paste the Project ID (no spaces) into the input, and it'll load that instead of a random project. Then, check the place where you kept the _main.py_ file on your computer, and you'll notice a new file is now there.

# Step Three: Upload

Upload the file into the /projects folder of this repo (in a branch), and make a PR so I can accept it later.
**First, check to make sure that the project hasn't already been backed up.**
If it's already been backed up, go to the backup that already exists, start to rename it, and change the name to

> /projects/\*insert the numbers here\***/old**

Then, in the folder you just made, upload the new backup as "**new**". This way, people can look for a newer or older backup. Do not backup, more than 1 copy of a project, as that would be spam. Only the oldest and newest remain, and you can replace the newest one as much as you like. Be sure to add [/templates/fork](this index.html file) to the folder, using the template, to allow people to quickly get their project.

# Step Four: Find a rock

Find a rock. Found one? Great. You're done.
