<h1>How to find your project</h1>
<br>
<p>Welcome to the site! We archive random projects, and projects that are requested, so you can always have a backup stored somewhere safe. In order to find your project, you can go to <a href=https://scoldercreations.github.io/scratcharchive/projects/1>https://scoldercreations.github.io/scratcharchive/projects/1</a> and change the "1" to the ID of your project.<br>
  Then, you should download the contents of the webpage as a .txt or .json, and upload them to Scratch! As long as you're connected to the internet, it'll be able to load the assets of your project.</p>
  <p>Want your project backed up? <a href=/404/>We got you covered.</a></p>
