<h1>How to find your project</h1>
<br>
<p>Welcome to the site! We archive random projects, and projects that are requested, so you can always have a backup stored somewhere safe. In order to find your project, you can go to <a href=https://scratchbackup.github.io/projects/1>/projects/1</a> and change the "1" to the ID of your project.<br>
  Then, you should download the contents of the webpage as a .txt or .json, and upload them to Scratch! As long as you're connected to the internet, it'll be able to load the assets of your project.</p>
  <p>Want your project backed up? <a href=/docs/req>We got you covered.</a></p>
  <br>
  <p>There is also a WIP search function, at <a href=/search>/search</a>.</p>
